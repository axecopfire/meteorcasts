##Stephen Grider's Udemy course on React/Meteor

Here's a ref to [Stephen's code for this course](https://github.com/stephengrider/meteorcasts)

Need to install chocolatey to install Meteor for Windows.
[Find that Here](https://chocolatey.org/install)

Need to install Meteor.js (With Chocolatey) just type `choco install meteor`

After that we run the command `meteor create images` (This creates the package.json and some other boilerplate)

To start web server `cd images` then `meteor`

Then we deleted the __Client__ and __Server__ folders so we can start from scratch.

We need to install React so we use the Node Package Manager `npm install --save react`

We also need to install `npm install --save react-dom`
